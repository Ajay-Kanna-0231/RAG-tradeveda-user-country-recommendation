He has said he also will raise concerns over rising tension in the South China Sea in a meeting with President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Monday. His government has taken credit for stabilising ties with Australia's largest trading partner since coming to office last year, as China lifted most trade blocks imposed in a 2020 diplomatic dispute that cost A$20 billion in commodity and food exports.
